# Three Trios Game
A Java based GUI application that allows for a card game played through player vs. player, AI vs. AI,
or a combination of both.

## Features ‚ú®
- Developed using the model-view-controller pattern using Java üì±
- Utilized abstraction and object-oriented design patterns üñ•Ô∏è
  - Adapter pattern, Decorator pattern, Observer pattern, and Strategy pattern
- Validated methods work as specified using mocks and JUnit tests üß™

## Game Instructions
- The goal of this card game is to own the most cards by the time the board is completely
filled up.
  - To count the amount of cards a player owns, add up the amount of cards with the player's
    color on the board and in their hand.
- Player 1 has the Red color and goes first. Player 2 has the Blue color and goes second.
- There are card cells on the board represented by the yellow squares, which are cells the players
  are able to place their cards on.
- There are hole cells on the board represented by gray squares, which are cells neither players
  can place their cards on.
- If a cell on the board already has a card, then no one can place a card on that cell.

## How to Run üöÄ
- Ensure you have JDK 11 or later installed.
- Make sure JUnit 4 is available for testing

1. git clone https://github.com/wong-bria/ThreeTrios.git
2. Open the project in the IDE of your choice.
3. Edit configurations and arguments. (Steps detailed in Arguments section)
4. Click run with configurations.

### Arguments
- X Y [[A] B]
  - Where X and Y are either "human", "strategy1", "strategy2", "strategy3", or "strategy4"
    (all without the quotes).
    - Refer to [link](#strat) Section for details on each strategy.
  - X represents Player 1 and Y represents Player2.
  - "human" represents a human playing, such as yourself.
  - "strategy1", "strategy2", "strategy3", and "strategy4" represents an AI playing
  - The square brackets, [], means that the arguments inside are optional and these arguments
    represents the card flipping rules that will be applied.
    - Arguments A, B can either be "default" (without the quotes) or empty string, "", which will
      both use the Flip Greater Rule, "reverse" to use the Reverse Rule, "fallen-ace" to use the 
      Fall Ace Rule, "same" to use the Same Rule, or "plus" to use the Plus Rule (all without the quotes)
      - Rules Flip Greataer Rule and Reverse cannot be used together as they contradict each other.
      - If Flip Greatear Rule, Reverse Rule, or Fallen Ace Rule aren't used, then Flip Greater 
        Rule will be applied.
      - If arguments A and B are both not given, then Flip Greater Rule will be used.
    - Refer to [link](#cardRules) Section for details on each card rule. 

## Codebase Information
The grid a player plays on is 0 index based where the origin starts at (0, 0) in the top left,
and as row increases it moves downward on the grid, and as column increases, it moves right on the grid.
The hands are a list where cards slide left when used.

### Quick start:
@Test
  public void QuickStartToUseCodebase() {
    // initialize a model
    ThreeTrioModel model = new ThreeTrioModel();
    // start the game with a board configuration file to be the grid played on
    // alongside a card configuration file to be the cards used in the game.
    model.startGame("BoardConfig" + File.separator + "HoleAndCardCellBoard",
            "CardConfig" + File.separator + "EnoughForAnyBoards");
    // initialize a view, taking in a model and Appendable, to display the game
    ThreeTrioGameView view = new ThreeTrioGameTextView(model, new StringBuilder());

    // allow player1 to play a card from their hand onto a (row,col) on the board
    model.playCard(0, 0, 2);
    // have the card battle neighboring card to the north, south, east, west
    model.battle();
    // allow player2 to play a card
    model.playCard(11, 0, 3);
    model.battle();

    // how a working game can look
    String expected = "Player: RED\n"
            + "__BB \n"
            + "     \n"
            + "     \n"
            + "     \n"
            + "     \n"
            + "Hand:\n"
            + "card3 1 2 3 4\n"
            + "card5 1 2 3 4\n"
            + "card7 1 2 3 4\n"
            + "card9 1 2 3 4\n"
            + "card11 1 2 3 4\n"
            + "card13 1 2 3 4\n"
            + "card15 1 2 3 4\n"
            + "card17 1 2 3 4\n"
            + "card19 1 2 3 4\n"
            + "card21 1 2 3 4\n"
            + "card23 1 2 3 4";
    Assert.assertEquals(expected, view.toString());
  }

### Key components:
Some key components are the file readers, model, and view, and controller.

The controller is the component that will drive the control-flow of our
system. It will handle interactions between the model, view, and user input/output. It also
controls the flow of the game by processing commands, updating game states, and creating outputs
to be displayed.

The file readers are driven by the model because they are called in the model's
startGame to create a list of cards and a grid of cells to be used in the game respectively.

The model is driven by the controller since the controller responds to user inputs and makes
requests to the model to either update game states or retrieve data. The model also drives
because when a game state changes, the model notifies the view to update the display.

The view is driven by the model because when the model changes, the view will update itself to
reflect the changes and match the game state in the model.

### Key subcomponents:
In file readers, key subcomponents: ReadCardConfig and ReadGridConfig.
    - ReadCardConfig: the main noun is card. It exists to read
      a card configuration file given by the user. It is used to create a list of cards to be played in
      the game.
    - ReadGridConfig: the main noun is grid. It exists to read a grid configuration file given by the user.
      It is used to create a list of list of cells.

In view, key subcomponent: ThreeTrioGameView.
    - ThreeTrioGameView: the main noun is game view. It exists and is used to display the current
      game state of a game of Three Trios.

In model, key subcomponent: Player, Cells, and Card.
    - Player: the main nouns are hand and color. It exists to represent a player playing a game of
      Three Trios. It is used to hold a list of cards and a color to represent which cards
      on a board belongs to them.
    - Cells: the main nouns are card and neighbors. It exists to represent either a card cell or hole cell.
      Cells are used to build a grid that the user will play on where if a cell is a hole cell, a user can't
      play a card on it, but if it's a card cell, then a user can play a card on it.
    - Card: the main nouns are name, color, and attack value. It exists to represent a card that holds
      information such as its name, color, and attack value in its north, south, east, and west directions.
      It is used to be played on a grid for a user to try and win a game of Three Trios.


### Source organization:
    - The file readers component can be found by opening the hw5 folder, then the src folder, and
      finally the filereaders folder.
    - The model component can be found by opening the hw5 folder, then the src folder, and
      finally the model folder.
    - The view component can be found by opening the hw5 folder, then the src folder, and finally
      the view folder.

Each of these components will also contain their key subcomponents inside of their respective
folders.

We decided to put ReadCardConfig and ReadGridConfig in a filereaders package because they
are focused on configuration and not directly modifying or maintaining game states,
handling user inputs, or displaying a view, thus it wouldn't be part of the model, controller,
 or view package but its own package instead.

 A card is in the format: String int int int int , or Name northValue southValue eastValue westValue

*** New Classes for Hw6 ***
    - ThreeTrios: Can be found inside the src folder. This class is currently used as a palceholder
    to run our view so we are able to see a visual representation of a Three Trio game.

    - Inside of strategy package:
        - Coordinate: The main noun is coordinate. It exists to represents a coordinate which
         contains a row and col in a grid. It is used to represent a location on a grid
         that a strategy should return.
        - CornerStrategy: A strategy that someone can use that prioritizes the placement of
        cards on corners. If no corners are available, place card from hand at index 0 at
        the uppermost, leftmost available cell.
        - FlipMostCardsStrategy: A strategy that someone can use that prioritizes the placement
        of cards on cells that will flip the most cards. If no flips are possible
        (a flip count of 0), place card from hand at index 0 at the uppermost, leftmost
        available cell.
        - LeastExposedStrategy: A strategy that someone can use that prioritizes the placement of
        cards on cells that expose the least amount directions of a card with the card that
        is hardest to flip. Best moves are returned in a list.
        - MinMaxStrategy: A strategy that someone can use that prioritizes the placement of
        cards on cells that minimizes the maximum flips an opponent can get the next turn.
        Best moves are returned in a list.
        - Tuple: Used to represent a tuple data type, which stores keys with corresponding
        values.

    - Inside of view package:
        - CardToJButton: The main noun is button. It exists to represent a card as a button.
        It is used to represent a card in a player's hand as as button which will allow
        users to interact with the cards in a hand.
        - GameGridPanel: The main noun is grid. It exists to represent a grid. It is used to
        represent a grid which users can interact with.
        - JFrameView: The main noun is frame. It exists to represent a frame containing
        two player hand panels and a grid. It is used to represent a frame containing
        all the information a player would see when playing a Three Trio game.
        - PlayerHandPanel: The main noun is hand. It exists to represent a panel
        which will be a player's hand. It is used to represent a player's hand containing
        cards.

    - Inside of controller package:
        - ThreeTrioController: The controller takes in the file name for a board and deck
        of card to be parsed and passed to the model.

*** Assignment 8 ***
    - Make sure to clearly document your new command-line options in your README,
      so graders know how to run your game.
      Our command-line options are: X Y
      where X and Y can be human, strategy1, strategy2, strategy3, or strategy4

*** Assignment 9 ***
    - We added a new feature that decorated the grid and allowed a user to toggle
      between having hints turned on or off. For hints to be toggled between
      on and off, player one would click 'q' and player two would click 'w'. For the hints to appear,
      the user must toggle hints on, then click on a card in their hand.
    - Added new rules to the game under model.ruled
        - The rule implementations follow the ThreeTrioRule interface, which has the following methods:
            - SatisfiesFlip: Returns true if the Cell, Neighboring Cell, and Direction to Neighbor satisfy
              the rule's flip condition.
            - ReverseSatisfiesFlip: Returns true if the intended inverse effect is reached. Some rules like
              FallenAce would accept nearly all plays as flips if we simply take the inverse of the
              output of SatisfiesFlip, so this method serves to differentiate the intended functions.
            - IsMutuallyExclusive: Returns true if the given rule and the current rule are mutually exclusive.
            - allowCombo: Returns true if this rule can be applied after combos (i.e. to battle after placed card).
        - FallenAceRule implements the Regular rule and Fallen Ace, where newly placed cards
          with greater opposing values overtake cards AND 1 overtakes Ace. The reverse is also
          true, where newly placed cards with smaller opposing values overtake cards AND Ace
          overtakes 1.
        - FlipGreaterRule implements the default rules of the game. Newly placed cards with
          greater values overtake old cards and vice versa if the game is reversed.
        - PlusRule implements a rule where cards are flipped if at least two opposing pairs of
          adjacent cards have the same sum with the current card in their respective opposing
          directions. Reversing this rule does nothing, since there is nothing to reverse (it
          would allow ALL cards to flip except those with an opposing sum of 10, which would
          ruin the flow of the game)
        - ReverseRule implements the reverse of the original rules. It acts functionally
          identically to FlipGreater, but instanceof is used to notify the model that
          the reverseSatisfiesFlip method is being used.
        - SameRule implements a new rule where cards with the same opposing values as
          the card played are flip IFF at least 2 cards satisfy this condition. The reverse
          acts functionally the same as the non-reversed version.
